# Aptitude_departwise_analysis
Analysis of students aptitude scores across departments using Quants, Reasoning, and Verbal marks

## Marks Distribution

The aptitude test is composed of three sections:


| Section    | Maximum Marks |
|------------|---------------|
| Quants     | 20            |
| Reasoning  | 15            |
| Verbal     | 15            |
| Total      | 50            |

Each studentâ€™s total aptitude score is the sum of the three sections.
